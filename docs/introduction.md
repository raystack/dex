# Introduction

Welcome to intro guide to Dex! This guide is the best place to start with Dex. We cover what Dex is, what problems it can solve, how it compares to existing DevOps practices, and how you can get started using it.

## What is Dex?

Dex is a platform that integrates all ODPF tools to provide a great experience for ODPF users.

## Why is dex required?

ODPF offers a suite of different data engineering tools. Each tool is designed with a specific use-case in mind and usually easy to setup. But in a real world setup, a lot of the tools also need to be configured & integrated to work together to get the most out of them.

Dex is being developed to reduce the support effort that goes into provisioning, integrating and scaling of these tools.

Dex will use [Entropy](https://github.com/goto/entropy) to provision and manage deployments of various ODPF tools.
